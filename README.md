# Recovering planetary transit signals in active PLATO-like stars using simulation and machine learning

This project focuses on generating synthetic PLATO-like stellar light curves for exoplanet transit detection under different stellar activity conditions.

### Features

- Synthetic light-curve generation
- Planetary transit injection
- Stellar activity simulation
- YAML-based parameter configuration
- Metadata CSV construction
- Statistical analysis and visualization
- Transit Least Squares (TLS) baseline detection
- Preparation for ML/DL classification
